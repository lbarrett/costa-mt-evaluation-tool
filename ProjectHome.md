A hotly debated topic in Machine Translation (MT) is human evaluation. It is extremely costly, time consuming but important and unfortunately inevitable part of any system. **COSTA MT Evaluation Tool** is a java program that can be used to evaluate manually the quality of the MT output. It is simple in use, designed to allow MT potential users and developers to analyse their systems using a friendly environment. It enables the ranking of the quality of MT output segment-by-segment for a particular language pair.

The benefits of this tool are multiple. Firstly, it is a rich repository of commonly used industry criteria (fluency, adequacy and translation error classification). Secondly, it is freely available to anyone and provides results that can be further analysed. Finally, it gives suggestions about the fuzzy matching of the candidate translations.
